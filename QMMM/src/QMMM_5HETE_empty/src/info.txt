# QM/MM simulation

# source code
- `qm_list`
	Contains the list of atoms 
		Protein
		Fe
		OH1
		LIG
- `amber_to_chemshell_modeller.py`
	Main script to perform conversions from amber to chemshell

- `generate_params.sh`
 	For each frame, it generates several extract .pdbs with the nonstandard coordination sphere residues HD1_359, HD2_364, HD3_539, HE1_543, IE1_662, and runs the template tleap.template for each frame (parametrizing each pdb frame) [requires ligand and iron parameters]. After parametrization, it runs amber_to_chemshell_modeller.py with the inpcrd and prmtop. 

- `fix_prmtop_for_chemsh.py`
	Modifies the .prmtop to make it compatible for ChemShell. This is done to every generated .prmtop for each frame using `generate_parms.sh`

- `pdb_to_c.sh`
	Converts the .pdb format to .c chemshell coordinate format. 

- `c_to_pdb.sh`
	Converts the .c format to .pdb format. 

- `atoms_list_to_pdb.py`
	Generates a .pdb from the qm atoms from `qm_list`. 


- `protein topology and coordinates`
	The .inpcrd and .prmtop and .pdb of the protein, WITHOUT LIGAND is needed. 


# JOB scripts
- opt.chm
	ChemShell script that runs optimization with srun chemshell

- scan_habs.chm
	ChemShell script that runs the scan

- script.sh
	Job script. Copy from Susana. Depends on the type of job: optimization or scan. 
	

# select the suitable frames from MD for the QM/MM calculation
- `frames` directory
	Stores the .pdb snapshots that are suitable

- `frame_selection.ipynb` 
	Selects the suitable snapshots according to some criteria. 


# PROTOCOL
1. Select the adequate frames from a MD simulation (save in a directory)
2. Generate topology (corrected) and coordinates, and convert them so that ChemShell understands.
