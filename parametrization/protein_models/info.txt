# protein info

# human15LOX 
# obtained through AF2 and protonated by persona universitat de Madrid.
# s'hauria de comprovar que els tritable residues s√≥n realment correctes wrt H++.

# human15LOX_mod
# same as human15LOX but with a rotamer of Arg402 to better match the ligand carboxylate. This modification has been done by hand using chemical intuition.

# both have been used in docking simulations, but have NOT been modified by GOLD. It has been saved by Chimera so that GOLD understands it.
